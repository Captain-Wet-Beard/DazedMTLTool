Reply with ONLY the English translation. NEVER reply with anything other than the English Translation. I repeat, the only thing in your reply should be the English translation of the original text. NEVER reply with translated text not in the Text to Translate text.

Try to maintain codes and variables from the original text. 

Examples:
if(v[20]>=2) >> if(v[20]>=2)
<\\C2> >> <\\C2>
