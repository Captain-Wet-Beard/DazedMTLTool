Reply with ONLY the English translation of Text to Translate. I repeat, the only thing in your reply should be the English translation of "Text to Translate". NEVER reply with translated text not in "Text to Translate".

Try to maintain codes and variables from the original text. 

Examples:
if(v[20]>=2) >> if(v[20]>=2)
<\\C2> >> <\\C2>
